### What is this repository for?

VentureChat Spigot plugin Repo

### How do I get set up?

Full setup and dependency guide is available here on SpigotMC: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/venturechat.771/

In short, Install `Vault` (and a compatable permission system), `ProtocolLib`, and `PlaceholderAPI` (`Player` and `Vault` extensions optional).

To build, simply run `mvn`.

Requires Java 8.

### Contribution guidelines

* Follow the existing style conventions. I used the default Eclipse formatting styleset for the majority of the project.
* Follow general Java best practices and object oriented principles. There are examples of poor practices in this existing legacy codebase, but that doesn't mean new contributions should stoop to that level.
* Include JavaDoc for your contribution. Same as stated above, most of this legacy codebase isn't documented, but that doesn't mean new contributions should also be undocumented. Especially important when multiple people are working on a project.
* Include unit tests for stand alone methods. I'm not expecting full coverage for complex Spigot events, etc, but for formatting or other non Spigot related code, tests would be much appreciated.

### Who do I talk to?

* I'd recommend discussing any change before making it to avoid wasting your time and my time. Especially for a major change or if it's your first time contributing. I am extremely responsive on my Spigot discussion board (above link).
